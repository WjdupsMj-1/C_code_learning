AND ONE CHANCE TO DO ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO. 
MAY YOU HAVE ENOUGH HAPPINESS TO

ALWAYS PUT YOURSELF IN OTHERS’SHOES.
IF YOU FEEL THAT IT HURTS YOU,IT PROBABLY HURTS THE OTHER PERSON.
AND ONE CHANCE TO DO ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO.

AND ONE CHANCE TO DO ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO. 
MAY YOU HAVE ENOUGH HAPPINESS TO
