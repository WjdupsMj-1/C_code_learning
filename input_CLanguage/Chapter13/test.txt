there are moments in life when you miss someone
so much that you just want to pick them from 
your dreams and hug them for real!
dream what you want to dream;
go where you want to go; 
be what you want to be, 
because you have only one life 
and one chance to do all the things you want to do. 
may you have enough happiness to  
make you sweet,enough trials to make you strong,
enough sorrow to keep you human,
enough hope to make you happy? 
always put yourself in others’shoes.
enough hope to make you happy? 
always put yourself in others’shoes.
